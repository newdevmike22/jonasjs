                    console: 'Portugal's population is above average'. Otherwise, log a string like
                    'Portugal's population is 22 million below average' (the 22 is the average of 33
                    minus the country's population).

                <li>
                    Declare a variable 'numNeighbours' based on a prompt input like this:
                    prompt('How many neighbour countries does your country
                    have?').
                </li>
                <li>
                    If there is only 1 neighbour, log to the console 'Only 1 border!' (use loose equality
                    == for now).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use an else-if block to log 'More than 1 border' in case 'numNeighbours'
                    is greater than 1.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use an else block to log 'No borders' (this block will be executed when
                    'numNeighbours' is 0 or any other value).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Test the code with different values of 'numNeighbours', including 1 and 0.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Change == to ===, and test the code again, with the same values of
                    'numNeighbours'. Notice what happens when there is exactly 1 border! Why
                    is this happening?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finally, convert 'numNeighbours' to a number, and watch what happens now
                    when you input 1.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reflect on why we should use the === operator and type conversion in this
                    situation.

                    island.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Write an if statement to help Sarah figure out if your country is right for her.
                    You will need to write a condition that accounts for all of Sarah's criteria. Take
                    your time with this, and check part of the solution if necessary.

                    If yours is the right country, log a string like this: 'You should live in Portugal'. If
                    not, log 'Portugal does not meet your criteria.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Probably your country does not meet all the criteria. So go back and temporarily
                    change some variables in order to make the condition true (unless you live in
                    Canada).

                    to log a string like this to the console: 'Portugal's population is above average'.
                    Otherwise, simply log 'Portugal's population is below average'. Notice how only
                    one word changes between these two sentences!
