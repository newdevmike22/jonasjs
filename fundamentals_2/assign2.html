            <ol>
                <li>
                    Write a function called 'describeCountry' which takes three parameters:
                    'country', 'population' and 'capitalCity'. Based on this input, the
                    function returns a string with this format: 'Finland has 6 million people and its
                    capital city is Helsinki'.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Call this function 3 times, with input data for 3 different countries. Store the
                    returned values in 3 different variables, and log them to the console.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    The world population is 7900 million people. Create a <strong>function declaration</strong>
                    called 'percentageOfWorld1' which receives a 'population' value, and
                    returns the percentage of the world population that the given population
                    represents. For example, China has 1441 million people, so it's about 18.2% of
                    the world population.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To calculate the percentage, divide the given 'population' value by 7900
                    and then multiply by 100.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Call 'percentageOfWorld1' for 3 populations of countries of your choice,
                    store the results into variables, and log them to the console.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a <strong>function expression</strong> which does the exact same thing, called
                    'percentageOfWorld2', and also call it with 3 country populations (can be
                    the same populations).

                    Create a function called 'describePopulation'. Use the function type you
                    like the most. This function takes in two arguments: 'country' and
                    'population', and returns a string like this: 'China has 1441 million people,
                    which is about 18.2% of the world.'

                    Create an array containing 4 population values of 4 countries of your choice.
                    You may use the values you have been using previously. Store this array into a

                    Create an array called 'percentages' containing the percentages of the
                    world population for these 4 population values. Use the function
                    'percentageOfWorld1' that you created earlier to compute the 4

            LECTURE: Basic Array Operations (Methods)
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Create an array containing all the neighbouring countries of a country of your
                    choice. Choose a country which has at least 2 or 3 neighbours. Store the array
                    into a variable called 'neighbours'.
                </li>
                <li>
                    At some point, a new country called 'Utopia' is created in the neighbourhood of
                    your selected country. So add it to the end of the 'neighbours' array.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Unfortunately, after some time, the new country is dissolved. So remove it from
                    the end of the array.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the 'neighbours' array does not include the country ‘Germany’, log to the
                    console: 'Probably not a central European country :D.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Change the name of one of your neighbouring countries. To do that, find the
                    index of the country in the 'neighbours' array, and then use that index to
                    change the array at that index position. For example, you can search for
                    'Sweden' in the array, and then replace it with 'Republic of Sweden'.
